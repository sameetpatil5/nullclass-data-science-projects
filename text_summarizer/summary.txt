 A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. Quantum computers are not yet practical for real work. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. In principle, a classical computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time.
